# tic-tac-toe

A sleek Tic-Tac-Toe experience with a React-powered interface. You play **O** while
the computer opens with **X** in the center.

## Setup

This project now runs without external Python dependencies. A recent version of
Python (3.9+) is all you need.

## Run the app

```bash
python main.py
```

The app will start a local static server (default: `http://localhost:8000`) that
serves the React UI. Open the printed URL in your browser to play.

## Customizing the port

Set the `PORT` environment variable before launching if you want a different port:

```bash
PORT=3000 python main.py
```
